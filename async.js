// synchronus vs asynchronus
// in asynchronus, many things can happen at a same time
//in synchronus one thing can only happen after a particular thing is done
//as I know JS is a synchronus single threaded language

//in js we can perform Async functionalities using these words
//async/await, callback, promises
